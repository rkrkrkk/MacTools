/// Rule catalog v2 (design §5.4 authoritative mapping).
///
/// Relation to v1 `DiskCleanRuleCatalog`:
/// - **Globs are kept verbatim**—whitelist storage and user mental models depend on these strings;
///   migration only changes ownership and metadata.
/// - All 43 v1 rules have an owner; `legacyRuleID` covers the full v1 rule-id set
///   (`DiskCleanRuleCatalogV2Tests` snapshot asserts this).
/// - Six places where the same glob appeared in two v1 rules (Codex five + `com.figma.Desktop`)
///   collapse to a single target in v2, so "each glob has exactly one owning target" holds.
/// - v1 pseudo-dynamic rules (`.xcodeDerivedData`, seven package-manager items, `.serviceWorkerCache`)
///   only ever used static fallback globs; v2 records them as path targets. The four rules that
///   truly need runtime decisions use `DiskCleanDynamicRules` providers.
///
/// `reservedRootPaths` are always hard-coded literals: value = each glob's **fixed directory prefix**
/// (last complete path component before the first glob metacharacter), deduped, in glob order.
/// Home-directory bare-file globs (`~/.zcompdump*`, `~/.gitconfig.bak*`) therefore derive `~`
/// itself—it only protects ancestors of `~` (`/Users`, `/`), a weak but correct reserved root.
/// Do not "helpfully deepen" it: reserved roots must be the glob's true fixed prefix; deepening
/// would leave unscanned sibling paths under the same prefix unprotected.
///
/// ## `requiresFullDiskAccess` decision (design §9)
///
/// **Predicate: mark true only when every glob of the target falls under a TCC-protected prefix.**
/// If any glob does not, leave the target unmarked so protected paths degrade individually as
/// `permissionDenied`—marking would skip **cleanable** paths in the same target too, costing more
/// than it saves. Mixed targets are therefore always split in two (split keeps `legacyRuleID`
/// unchanged so the v1 mapping snapshot is unaffected).
///
/// Recognized protected prefixes, and why each must be skipped:
/// - `~/Library/Containers/`, `~/Library/Group Containers/`: macOS 14+
///   `kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAppData`. **This class prompts** (and the grant is process-lifetime only);
///   expanding a dozen globs would mean a dozen prompts—exactly what design §9 avoids.
/// - `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari`, `~/Library/Safari`: Safari storage under the platform
///   sandbox policy, pure FDA protection, no prompt, silent EPERM.
/// - `~/Library/Suggestions`, `~/Library/Calendars`, `~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook`:
///   FDA / Calendar / Contacts service protection, also silent EPERM. Not skipping only yields
///   unreadable empty candidates.
///
/// Deliberately **not** recognized (readable; marking would drop cleanup for free):
/// `~/Library/Caches` itself, `~/Library/Saved Application State`, `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.helpd`,
/// `~/Library/Caches/GeoServices`, `~/Library/DiagnosticReports`.
/// `~/Library/Autosave Information` and `~/Library/IdentityCaches` lack evidence and are treated as
/// unprotected—a wrong guess only degrades those two to `permissionDenied` and does not affect
/// other paths in the same target.
///
/// `DiskCleanRuleCatalogV2Tests` reverse-derives flags from the same prefix table and compares
/// entry-by-entry; drift in either direction fails.
