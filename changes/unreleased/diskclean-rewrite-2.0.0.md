Disk Cleanup is rewritten for faster scanning and safer deletion. It now covers system caches, developer artifacts, and leftover installers; moves items to Trash by default; skips Full Disk Access–protected paths until authorized; blocks incomplete or locked results from cleanup; and rejects overly broad developer-artifact scan folders such as Home or system locations.
